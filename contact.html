          <h2>Life of Jordan Garland</h2> 
          <p> Growing up, I was very fond of the arts of craftmenship and being able to build things on my own. Throughout my current time on earth I have had many opportunities to build such things and experience what its like to all on my own.
              Realizing how fun it was, this soon led to my discovery of video games and mods for them. I was really enjoying the time I had gaming on consoles such as my PS2, PS3 and even a PS4
